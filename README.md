Combined Reward-Learning Task: Data Analysis & Extraction
========================================
Extracts and summarises logfile data for each stage of the combined task.

###STAGES  
####_**Contingency Variation**_  
- 6 trials
- High Contingnecy vs. Low Contingency Responses
- Rating: High vs. Low Contingency

####_**Outcome Devaluation**_
- Instrumental Training (R1-O1, R2-O2)
- Devaluation
- Extinction Test (R1, R2)
- Reacquisition Test (R1- O1, R2 - O2)

###OUTPUT

####*Contingency Variation*  
- **AVERAGE** High Contingency vs. Low Contingency Responses
- **AVERAGE** High Contingency vs. Low Contingency Outcomes Earned
- **AVERAGE** High Contingency vs. Low Contingency Ratings

####*Devaluation*
- **Instrumental Training**: (To Be) Deval vs. Non Deval Responses
- **Instrumental Training**: Outcomes Earned
- **Extinction**: Deval vs. Non Deval Responses
- **Reacquisition**: Deval vs. Non Deval Responses

###**MORE TO COME!**


####To Be Added  
- Binned Responding
- Response Latency
- Outcomes Earned in Reacquisition
